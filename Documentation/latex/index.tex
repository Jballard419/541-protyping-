We are in the process of designing a virtual-\/reality application that will allow for users to learn and play a keyboard. The core of the application is comprised of a virtual keyboard, hand-\/tracking of the user, a sheet-\/music module that updates in real-\/time, and a lesson module that shows the user what notes on the keyboard to play. Additional features such as 360\textdegree{} backgrounds, recording, playback and options for modifying the sound of the keyboard will be implemented as well if time allows. The application is designed for the Oculus Rift and user input is provided via the Leap Motion peripheral.\hypertarget{index_mainpagedevelopers}{}\section{Development Team}\label{index_mainpagedevelopers}

Screenshots (maybe 1-\/3 depending on different states?) of the app should be put here once Prototype I is finished. The screenshots should be updated for every prototype.
