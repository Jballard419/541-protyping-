\hypertarget{group___audio_AudioInfo}{}\subsection{Information}\label{group___audio_AudioInfo}
Samples for the piano and marimba were obtained from Electronic Music Studios at the University of Iowa (\href{http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MIS.html}{\tt http\+://theremin.\+music.\+uiowa.\+edu/\+M\+I\+S.\+html}). These samples are provided from Electronic Music Studios to the public for any use without restrictions. ~\newline
 Samples for the drums were obtained from Drum\+Gizmo (\href{http://www.drumgizmo.org/wiki/doku.php?id=about}{\tt http\+://www.\+drumgizmo.\+org/wiki/doku.\+php?id=about}) and are used under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.\+0 Unported license (\href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/}{\tt https\+://creativecommons.\+org/licenses/by/3.\+0/}). The kit used was the D\+R\+S\+Kit (\href{http://www.drumgizmo.org/wiki/doku.php?id=kits:drskit}{\tt http\+://www.\+drumgizmo.\+org/wiki/doku.\+php?id=kits\+:drskit}).\hypertarget{group___audio_DefVel}{}\subsubsection{Velocity}\label{group___audio_DefVel}
Velocity is a term taken from M\+I\+DI that refers to the volume of the note. Unlike M\+I\+DI where the velocity ranges from 0-\/127, the velocity of notes for this project range from 0-\/100 so that they can be used like a percentage. ~\newline
 A velocity of 0 means that the note is silent. A velocity of 100 means that the note is as loud as it can possibly be.\hypertarget{group___audio_DefBID}{}\subsubsection{Built-\/\+In Dynamics}\label{group___audio_DefBID}
This term refers to the capability that some instruments have for using different sound files depending on the velocity of a note. ~\newline
 Right now only the \hyperlink{class_piano}{Piano} supports this. There are three different sound files for each pitch which are labelled pp (pianissimo), mf (mezzoforte), or ff (fortissimo).\hypertarget{group___audio_DefBIDThresh}{}\paragraph{Built-\/\+In Dynamics Thresholds}\label{group___audio_DefBIDThresh}
This term refers to the thresholds for when to use a specific Built-\/\+In Dynamic. For example, the thresholds for the \hyperlink{class_piano}{Piano} are \mbox{[}50, 75, 100\mbox{]}. This means that velocities of 50 and under use the pp files, velocities of 51-\/75 use the mf files, and velocities of 76-\/100 use the ff files.\hypertarget{group___audio_DefBPM}{}\subsubsection{B\+PM}\label{group___audio_DefBPM}
This term is an abbreviation for Beats Per Minute. It refers to the tempo of a song.
