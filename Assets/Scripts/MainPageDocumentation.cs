 * @section mainpageinfo Information
 * We are in the process of designing a virtual-reality application that will allow for users to learn and 
 * play a keyboard. The core of the application is comprised of a virtual keyboard, hand-tracking of the user, 
 * a sheet-music module that updates in real-time, and a lesson module that shows the user what notes on the 
 * keyboard to play. Additional features such as 360&deg; backgrounds, recording, playback and options for 
 * modifying the sound of the keyboard will be implemented as well if time allows. The application is 
 * designed for the Oculus Rift and user input is provided via the Leap Motion peripheral.
